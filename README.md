### Prototyping

Most prototyping has been done using the [GOV.UK prototyping tool kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit/).

This runs on [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) which is a node framework.

This will get you up and running with the basics for a prototype for a service this includes many of the base elements (forms/texts) etc. and styles.

There are deployment guides available on the alphagov github account.
